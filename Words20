full of pride

witty 诙谐的；机智的

I've just finished reading a really good book.

It's about Elizabeth, an honest, lovely, witty girl.

It's my favorite book of all time.

Once upon a time, there was a pretty proud woman.

Their first impression of each other are not very good.

The funny thing is, they keep running into each other.

Something is bringing them together.

It has the perfect ending--they fall in love and live together ever after.

They are meant to be together.
