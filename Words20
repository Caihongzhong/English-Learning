full of pride

witty 诙谐的；机智的

I've just finished reading a really good book.

It's about Elizabeth, an honest, lovely, witty girl.

It's my favorite book of all time.

Once upon a time, there was a pretty proud woman.

Their first impression of each other are not very good.

Something is bringing them together.

It has the perfect ending--they fall in love and live together ever after.

They are meant to be together.

The sooner I read this how-to book, the easier it'll be for me to fix the sink.

The more dangerous things get, the more courageous the hero gets.

Personally, I love getting lost in a good historical fiction.

The story has to pull me in, or I'll stop reading.
